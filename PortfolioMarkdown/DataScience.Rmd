# About me: **Samuel C.**

**Undergraduate Student | BSc. in Biotechnology | [CV Webpage](../index.html)**

I am a Biotechnology undergraduate student working with data analysis for biological data (focus on Bioinformatics pipelines). Recently, from my experience with web scraping and data visualization in research projects, I started to provide freelance services and specialize as a data analyst. I aim to identify the specific features for each task, accomplished through communication with the client/colleagues and dedication to delivering impact results. Most importantly, as a data analyst in formation, I always seek to learn new tools/packages contributing to diversifying results for each project.

Languages that I am working with:   

- R

- Bash

**My Services:**

- Data Visualization

- Data Cleaning

- Statistical Descriptive/Exploratory Analysis
